# xkpass.io - xkcd-inspired passphrase via curl

Inspired by [xkpasswd.net](https://github.com/bartificer/xkpasswd-js), known for generating secure but memorable passwords, this process is intended to do the same but via curl and terminal. Think icanhazip.com or ifconfig.me, but for password generation.

This project is running at https://xkpass.io for easy querying.
